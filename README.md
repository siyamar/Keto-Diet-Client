#5 bullet points:
--> My website name is Keto Journey and it has many pages and many features. A user will login to this complete website and he can view different types of blogs and he can also post some blogs himself
--> When a user logs in, he can go to the add blog page and added the block and view the various pages well
--> No user can click on the Wishlist button and go to the Wishlist page without logging in.
--> The home page will have the most recent posts and there is an About Us section and a section called Newslist and a section called Gallery.
--> There is a page called All Blogs where all blogs will be shown and from here clicking on the Wishlist button will save them to the Wishlist page with user information.
--> Every blog in All Blogs page has a button called Details where clicked will show the details of the blog going to a page with details, And going there we can comment a lot about the blog. Everyone except the user who created this blog can go there and comment. And the user who created this block will not be able to go there and comment but when he goes there he will get an update button and there he will click on the update button and go to the update drop down page and from there he can update it.
--> Finally from my website I tried to keep private and home page responsive and light mode and light mode.
